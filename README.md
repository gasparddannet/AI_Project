# AI_Project
## Gate Allocation Problem

A Makefile is available 

You just need to execute the command `make` to compile all the files.

And then `./main` to execute the project.

Or if the makefile doesn't work, type in the following command :

`g++ Date.cpp Operation.cpp RecuitSimule.cpp Parking.cpp Stay.cpp Read.cpp Solution.cpp main.cpp -o main`
