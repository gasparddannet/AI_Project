# Gate Allocation Problem
## A Simulated annealing in C++ for Gate Allocation Problem

Implementation of a simulated annealing algorithm in C++ for optimizing the allocation of aircraft parking points.

A Makefile is available 

You just need to execute the command `make` to compile all the files.

And then `make run` to execute the project.

Or if the makefile doesn't work, type in the following command :

`g++ TXTWrite.cpp Date.cpp Operation.cpp RecuitSimule.cpp Parking.cpp Stay.cpp Read.cpp Solution.cpp RandomizeSubset.cpp  SelectiveMutationSubset.cpp Randomize.cpp MutateMinusOne.cpp NonAllocAndContact.cpp main.cpp -o main`
